# School_District_Analysis.

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis to go over the reading and math grades because the grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appeard to have been altered. I had to replace the scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. After replacing the scores I had to repeat the school district analysis that I did in the module and then write this report and describe how the changes affected the overall analysis. 

## Results 
The district summary was not affected by the change
The change did not really affect the other schools 
For the school summary the passing percentage for math dropped from a 93.2% to a 67%, the reading passing percentage dropped from a 97.3% to a 70%  and the overall passing percentage dropped from a 91% to a 65%.

As a whole the change did not to affect the other schools at all but for grade 9th at Thomas High School math and reading scores were replaced by NaN

The scores by school sizes also did not change
